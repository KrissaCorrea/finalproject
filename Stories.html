        <h4>The Love Tank</h4>
    <p>The whole world paused this morning because an 8 year old’s love tank was empty. 
        <br><br>
        The boys had already started their school day at their desks, and I was preparing to leave for work when I noticed my youngest standing in the bathroom wiping his face. 
        I paused at the door and asked if he was okay.  He looked up with tears silently dripping and shook his head. When I questioned if something happened, again he shook his head. 
        So I sat on the side of the tub and pulled him in my lap.  <br><br>I told him, "Sometimes our heart tanks feel empty, and need to be refilled." 
        He cried into my chest and I held him tight. <br><br>
        I asked, "can you feel my love filling you up?"<br><br>
        With a nod, the tears stopped. I waited a minute. <br><br>
        "Has it reached your toes yet?"
        He shook his head no. <br><br>
        "Okay, little man.  We will take as long as you need.  Work doesn’t matter right now. School isn’t important either. This, right here, is the most important thing today... Filling you back to the top. Does that sound good?" He nodded.
       <br><br>
        I waited for another minute. "Is your heart full of mamas love now?"<br><br>
        “Yeah....” I looked into his eyes as he smiled and saw it... <br><br>
        "There it is, I see it shining in there, you’re full to the top!" <br><br>
        You may not be 8, but ALL of us, no matter what age, run on empty sometimes.  <br><br>
        We all have to pause and take a moment to refill with the good things.  Sunshine, singing, laughter, friends, hugs, nature, prayer — We need to refill our empty tanks, or we'll find those negative emotions overflowing with no reason why. 
        <br><br>Take a moment.  Refill.  It’s the most important part of your day!   </p>

<h4> Best Version of Herself </h4>
<p>When a woman is loved the right way, her walls will tumble down. 

    She allows the best parts of herself to come out into the open and shine their brightest. She feels safe enough to show her true self. 
    
    She will value a man who shows her that he can be trusted. She will appreciate his efforts and double them.
    
    When she is given all she needs, she doesn’t mind being the one who gives even more. <br><br>
    When a woman is loved the right way, she becomes even stronger. 
    She is already strong all by herself, but the sense of love coming her way will heighten that feeling. 
    And though she is independent, she will be relieved she has somebody to finally lean on; someone who will hold her tight through the sunshine and the storms of life. 
    <br><br>
When a woman is loved the right way, she will speak her mind freely. 

She made the mistake of bottling up her feelings inside and not speaking about them so many times before, and she knows it only made things worse. 
She is doing things differently now. If she is offended and disrespected in any way, she won’t stay silent. She will say it aloud.
She expects her significant other to do the same because she knows that she’s not perfect either.

She knows that there is no point in brushing things under the carpet. Communication is everything. 

Before, she was scared that if she spoke up, if she said that something was bothering her, it would make the person she was with walk away. 

She’s not scared anymore because she knows that the right man will stay by her side no matter what. 
<br><br>
When a woman is loved the right way, she will be inspired to greatness.

The toxic relationships she had before took too much from her.

They made her doubt herself. They exhausted her energy and drained her emotionally.

They tried to tame her, to cut her wings, to make her feel like she wasn’t enough. A strong and healthy relationship will make her fly. <br><br>
When a woman is loved the right way, she will reach her full potential.

She will get the support she always needed. She will have someone who will compliment her instead of belittling her, someone who has faith that she has what it takes to succeed.  
Because of it, she will feel free to be herself. Because of it, she will be ten times the woman she already is. 

All the emotions coming her way are making her believe that she can rule the world.

She could do that with her self-love, too, but it’s so much easier when someone who supports her is right by her side. 
<br><br>
When a woman is loved the right way, she will carry happiness wherever she goes. 

“You have to love yourself first, so that somebody could love you too,” are the words she learned to live by.

She knows now that she is worthy of love, and she is not settling for less than she deserves.  
<br><br>
When real love knocks on her door, she will feel the warmth from the inside. She will be radiant from all the little displays of affection she is getting. 

All the attention, all the free time, texts and calls will flow without any force.

She will appreciate those little big things he does more than anything. 
<br><br>
That’s why when she is loved, the right way, she will have that glow on her face and that spark in her eyes.
She will be genuinely happy, and she will want to share that happiness with everyone around her.

        <h4>Cows Don't Give Milk</h4>
        <p>A farmer used to say to his children when they were young, "When you all  reach the age of  12  I will tell you the secret of life." <br><br> One day when the oldest turned 12, he anxiously asked his father what was the secret of life. The father replied that he was going to tell him, but that he should not reveal it to his brothers. <br><br>
           "The secret of life is this: The cow does not give milk."<br><br> "What are you saying?" Asked the boy incredulously. "As you hear it, son: The cow does not give milk, you have to milk it. You have to get up at 4 in the morning, go to the field, walk through the corral full of manure, tie the tail, hobble the legs of the cow, sit on the stool, place the bucket and do the work yourself."<br><br>
            That is the secret of life, the cow does not give milk. You milk her or you don't get milk. We live in a generation that thinks that cows GIVE milk. The things that one receives are the effort of what one does. <br><br>Happiness is the result of effort. Lack of effort creates frustration. 
            So, remember to share with your children, from a young age, the secret of life. 
            <br><br>Remember 
             "Cows don't give milk. You have to work for it."</p>
